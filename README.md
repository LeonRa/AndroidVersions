# Android Versions

A simple list application used for teaching introductory Android. This project quite intentionally
avoids the use of MVVM patterns and architectural libraries in order to keep code simple. The only
exception to the rule here is Jetpack Navigation, which tends to remove quite a bit of manual
Fragment management complexity.
